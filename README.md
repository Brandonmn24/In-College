# Florida InCollege

Compact README for the `florida-incollege` project.

## Project overview

This repository contains a small COBOL project (epics and source files) used for the "Florida InCollege" exercise. The codebase includes COBOL source files in `src/` and helper artifacts in `bin/` and `epics/`.

Main goals:
- Provide a working COBOL example (build and run).
- Keep simple task automation for building/running via VS Code tasks.

Branch: `dev` (development branch in the workspace). Default branch is `main`.

## Prerequisites

- GNU COBOL (cobc) installed. On Debian/Ubuntu this is typically provided by the `gnucobol` package.
- A POSIX-like shell (Linux/macOS). The dev container for this workspace is Ubuntu 22.04.

## Build & run

This repository includes VS Code tasks (in the workspace) for building and running COBOL files. The tasks use common patterns and compile into a `bin/` directory.

VS Code tasks available in this workspace:
- `COBOL: Build active file` — compiles the current COBOL file into `bin/`.
- `COBOL: Run active file` — builds then runs the compiled binary.
- `COBOL: Build and Run active file` — a combined task that builds (to a local `bin/`) and then runs.

Manual commands (example) — run from the repository root to build `src/main.cob` and run it:

```bash
mkdir -p bin
cobc -x -free -o bin/main src/main.cob
./bin/main
```

Replace `main` and `src/main.cob` with the target filename (without extension is used for the binary name in the VS Code tasks).

## Repository layout

- `src/` — COBOL source files (e.g., `main.cob`, `authenticate.cob`).
- `bin/` — compiled binaries (generated by build tasks/commands).
- `epics/` — epic-related assets and artifacts.
- `input.txt`, `output.txt` — sample input/output files used by the project.
- `README.md` — this file.
- `LICENSE` — license for the repository.

## How to contribute

1. Create an issue describing the change or bug.
2. Create a feature branch (e.g., `epic_x` or `fix/…`) from `main` or the relevant epic branch.
3. Open a pull request describing the change and link related issues.

Keep changes small and include a brief test or reproduction steps when possible.

## Notes

- This project uses simple, local build steps (no external CI configured in the workspace by default). If you add CI, document the steps and requirements here.
- If you need help installing GNU COBOL on your platform, include your OS and I'll add platform-specific instructions.
